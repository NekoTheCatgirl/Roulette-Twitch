# Roulette bot!
Hi! This is a simple roulette bot that has a 1/6 chance to timeout the user of the command `?!roulette`

To start the bot, simply do:
`roulette --broadcaster-login <your username>`

## Credits
[twitch_api](https://github.com/twitch-rs/twitch_api/blob/main/examples/chatbot/src/main.rs) for making this possible, and providing a easy to use example (part of the code is copied to simplify the development with known good code)
